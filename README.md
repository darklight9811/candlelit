# WIP: candlelit
Candlelit is a bundle of useful functions and patterns to help you build your own matches for entry points in any market.
Developed by Rafael Correa Chaves and Guilherme Vitorino as a way to easily implement and detect graphical patterns in new projects, candlelit is a easy solution for any programmer. If you wish to contribute any patterns we miss, you can write an email to: rafael.correa@aposoftworks.com or a new issue to our github with the title: [NP] <name of your pattern>. We hope you like it and enjoy using it.

## Patterns available

Remember that testing a large chart with many patterns can be a costy process, so avoid using it every change you make to the chart. Or scope to the patterns you actually care about.
